Record the chosen pattern and rationale in `STORIES.md` when it is novel.\n- **Consistent layer naming**: production implementations use the `PascalCaseLive` suffix and mocks use `PascalCaseMock`. Avoid hand-rolled helpers; compose full Layers instead.\n- **Single source of truth**: update `STORIES.md` (or the relevant doc) whenever you add a new service, migration, or workflow so the backlog stays trustworthy.\n- **Small commits, clear stories**: each story should map to a commit or PR slice with an explicit DoD. Leave TODOs only when the follow-up story already exists.\n\n## Repository Orientation\n- Root workspace is `pnpm`-based with packages `server`, `web`, and `shared`. Scripts such as `dev:server`, `dev:web`, `lint`, and `test` are scaffolds; keep them wired even if they echo TODO.\n- `.env.example` declares required environment variables: `PORT`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, `ADMIN_KEY`.\n- `packages/shared`: owns runtime-shared TypeScript codecs (`ApiSchemas`, `WebhookSchemas`). Keep schemas colocated here and import them from server/web.\n- `packages/server` key areas:\n  - `src/runtime/NodeRuntime.ts`: entrypoint for composing Layers; always wire new services here.\n  - `src/config/Config.ts`: environment schema via `@effect/schema`. Extend it when a story introduces a new env var.\n  - `src/logger/Logger.ts`: structured JSON logging. Preserve requestId propagation.\n  - `src/http`: platform server setup, routes, and SSE endpoints.\n  - `src/db`: Effect-based Postgres access. `schema/*.ts` files expose repositories; keep them side-effect free.\n  - `src/github`: token-backed HTTP client, webhook verification, and event handlers.\n  - `migrations/*.sql`: sequential, zero-downtime migrations; never edit existing files, always add a new numbered migration.\n  - `scripts/migrate.ts`: kicks off `Migrations.run()`; extend when migrations runner gains features.\n- `packages/web`: SvelteKit frontend with Tailwind; pulls codecs from `shared` and listens to SSE events from the server.\n\n## Working a Story\n1. Confirm prerequisites in `STORIES.md` and ensure dependent stories are complete.\n2. Sketch the Effect wiring (new Layer, service tag, constructor). List new dependencies in the story notes.\n3. Update or add migrations/scripts before repository code that uses them. Run migrations locally when the tooling is available.\n4. Fill in stubs instead of replacing them wholesale so later stories remain diff-friendly.\n5. When implementing webhook handlers, ensure idempotency paths are preserved and rate-limit helpers (`withRateLimit`) are applied where required.\n6. Record notable decisions and follow-up tickets directly in the backlog or doc comments.\n\n## Database & Migrations\n- Files live in `packages/server/migrations` and follow zero-padded numbering (`000_init.sql`, `001_repos.sql`, ...).\n- Every migration must have a corresponding repository change in `packages/server/src/db/schema`. Keep SQL and TypeScript updates in the same story so the system stays deployable.\n- Use effectful repositories (`Effect.gen` + `Db.sql`) to encapsulate queries. Avoid leaking raw SQL into route handlers.\n- Populate fixtures in `packages/server/test/fixtures` whenever you add new tables or columns; future tests rely on them.\n\n## GitHub Integration Guardrails\n- `GithubClient` must attach the PAT/App token, log rate-limit headers, and respect the rate-limit guard (`S-035`).\n- Webhook verification uses SHA-256 with the shared secret in `WEBHOOK_SECRET`; never store raw payloads without hashing or encryption.\n- Event handlers should upsert repos, runs, and jobs atomically so the dashboard never shows partial data.\n- Document any new webhook types or payload nuances in `packages/server/docs/webhook-dev.md`.\n\n## API & Realtime Expectations\n- Public API endpoints live under `packages/server/src/http/routes/api*.ts`; validate all input with shared codecs.\n- SSE events (`EventsHub`) must broadcast `run_created`, `run_updated`, and `job_updated` events. Preserve compatibility when adding new event types by gating them behind optional filtering.\n- Keep admin routes guarded by the `X-Admin-Key` middleware. Never bypass it in production code; use mocks in tests instead.\n\n## Frontend Collaboration Notes\n- Fetch data exclusively through the shared codecs to keep server and client types in sync.\n- Subscribe to `/events` for live updates and debounce UI mutations to avoid jitter.\n- Favor progressive enhancement: render server data first, then layer SSE updates and admin actions.\n\n## Quality & Observability\n- Add tests as harnesses become available. Target `packages/server/vitest.config.ts` and `packages/web/vitest.config.ts`.\n- Extend structured logging with correlation IDs for new async flows (hydration, backfill, reconcile).\n- Track metrics locally in memory until a long-term sink is introduced; keep counters cheap to reset so tests can verify them.\n- When new operational tasks appear (backups, pruning, security), append the acceptance checklist in `STORIES.md` and open a matching story.\n\n## Working With Documentation & Memories\n- Re-read `STORIES.md` and the architecture memories at the beginning of each session.\n- When you discover a better pattern or adapt an Effect idiom, update both `STORIES.md` and this guide as needed.\n- Keep Context7 references fresh by re-fetching relevant effect documentation before implementing unfamiliar patterns.\n\n## Commit Message Format\n- Use Conventional Commit syntax: `type(scope): short summary` with lowercase verbs (e.g., `feat(server): add jobs repository`).\n- Supported `type` values: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`, `revert`.\n- Scope reflects the primary package or area (`server`, `web`, `shared`, `docs`, etc.); prefer narrower scopes when touching a single subsystem.\n- Begin the summary with an action and keep it under 72 characters; expand on context in the body if needed.\n- Reference sprint story IDs in the body (e.g., `Refs S-014`) so backlog tracking stays automatic.\n- For multi-part commits, separate breaking changes into their own commit with a `!` marker (`feat(server)!: rename jobs table`) and describe the impact in the body.\n\n## Handy Commands & References\n- `pnpm install`: wire workspace dependencies after pulling a story branch.\n- `pnpm --filter server dev`: (scaffold) start the server once runtime layers are in place.\n- `pnpm --filter server migrate`: run `scripts/migrate.ts` through the configured runner.\n- `pnpm --filter web dev`: (scaffold) launch the SvelteKit frontend.\n- External docs: [Effect-TS](https://effect.website/docs), Context7 effect-patterns repo, GitHub REST/Webhook docs.\n\nStay disciplined about the backlog, document decisions, and keep layers composable so every agent can land work quickly without surprises.\n\n## Standards Reference\n\nThe detailed standards now live under `standards/*.md` and are indexed in [STANDARDS.md](./STANDARDS.md).
