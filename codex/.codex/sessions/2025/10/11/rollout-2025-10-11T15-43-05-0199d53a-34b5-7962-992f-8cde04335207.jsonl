Record the chosen pattern and rationale in `STORIES.md` when it is novel.\n- **Consistent layer naming**: production implementations use the `PascalCaseLive` suffix and mocks use `PascalCaseMock`. Avoid hand-rolled helpers; compose full Layers instead.\n- **Single source of truth**: update `STORIES.md` (or the relevant doc) whenever you add a new service, migration, or workflow so the backlog stays trustworthy.\n- **Small commits, clear stories**: each story should map to a commit or PR slice with an explicit DoD. Leave TODOs only when the follow-up story already exists.\n\n## Repository Orientation\n- Root workspace is `pnpm`-based with packages `server`, `web`, and `shared`. Scripts such as `dev:server`, `dev:web`, `lint`, and `test` are scaffolds; keep them wired even if they echo TODO.\n- `.env.example` declares required environment variables: `PORT`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, `ADMIN_KEY`.\n- `packages/shared`: owns runtime-shared TypeScript codecs (`ApiSchemas`, `WebhookSchemas`). Keep schemas colocated here and import them from server/web.\n- `packages/server` key areas:\n  - `src/runtime/NodeRuntime.ts`: entrypoint for composing Layers; always wire new services here.\n  - `src/config/Config.ts`: environment schema via `@effect/schema`. Extend it when a story introduces a new env var.\n  - `src/logger/Logger.ts`: structured JSON logging. Preserve requestId propagation.\n  - `src/http`: platform server setup, routes, and SSE endpoints.\n  - `src/db`: Effect-based Postgres access. `schema/*.ts` files expose repositories; keep them side-effect free.\n  - `src/github`: token-backed HTTP client, webhook verification, and event handlers.\n  - `migrations/*.sql`: sequential, zero-downtime migrations; never edit existing files, always add a new numbered migration.\n  - `scripts/migrate.ts`: kicks off `Migrations.run()`; extend when migrations runner gains features.\n- `packages/web`: SvelteKit frontend with Tailwind; pulls codecs from `shared` and listens to SSE events from the server.\n\n## Working a Story\n1. Confirm prerequisites in `STORIES.md` and ensure dependent stories are complete.\n2. Sketch the Effect wiring (new Layer, service tag, constructor). List new dependencies in the story notes.\n3. Update or add migrations/scripts before repository code that uses them. Run migrations locally when the tooling is available.\n4. Fill in stubs instead of replacing them wholesale so later stories remain diff-friendly.\n5. When implementing webhook handlers, ensure idempotency paths are preserved and rate-limit helpers (`withRateLimit`) are applied where required.\n6. Record notable decisions and follow-up tickets directly in the backlog or doc comments.\n\n## Database & Migrations\n- Files live in `packages/server/migrations` and follow zero-padded numbering (`000_init.sql`, `001_repos.sql`, ...).\n- Every migration must have a corresponding repository change in `packages/server/src/db/schema`. Keep SQL and TypeScript updates in the same story so the system stays deployable.\n- Use effectful repositories (`Effect.gen` + `Db.sql`) to encapsulate queries. Avoid leaking raw SQL into route handlers.\n- Populate fixtures in `packages/server/test/fixtures` whenever you add new tables or columns; future tests rely on them.\n\n## GitHub Integration Guardrails\n- `GithubClient` must attach the PAT/App token, log rate-limit headers, and respect the rate-limit guard (`S-035`).\n- Webhook verification uses SHA-256 with the shared secret in `WEBHOOK_SECRET`; never store raw payloads without hashing or encryption.\n- Event handlers should upsert repos, runs, and jobs atomically so the dashboard never shows partial data.\n- Document any new webhook types or payload nuances in `packages/server/docs/webhook-dev.md`.\n\n## API & Realtime Expectations\n- Public API endpoints live under `packages/server/src/http/routes/api*.ts`; validate all input with shared codecs.\n- SSE events (`EventsHub`) must broadcast `run_created`, `run_updated`, and `job_updated` events. Preserve compatibility when adding new event types by gating them behind optional filtering.\n- Keep admin routes guarded by the `X-Admin-Key` middleware. Never bypass it in production code; use mocks in tests instead.\n\n## Frontend Collaboration Notes\n- Fetch data exclusively through the shared codecs to keep server and client types in sync.\n- Subscribe to `/events` for live updates and debounce UI mutations to avoid jitter.\n- Favor progressive enhancement: render server data first, then layer SSE updates and admin actions.\n\n## Quality & Observability\n- Add tests as harnesses become available. Target `packages/server/vitest.config.ts` and `packages/web/vitest.config.ts`.\n- Extend structured logging with correlation IDs for new async flows (hydration, backfill, reconcile).\n- Track metrics locally in memory until a long-term sink is introduced; keep counters cheap to reset so tests can verify them.\n- When new operational tasks appear (backups, pruning, security), append the acceptance checklist in `STORIES.md` and open a matching story.\n\n## Working With Documentation & Memories\n- Re-read `STORIES.md` and the architecture memories at the beginning of each session.\n- When you discover a better pattern or adapt an Effect idiom, update both `STORIES.md` and this guide as needed.\n- Keep Context7 references fresh by re-fetching relevant effect documentation before implementing unfamiliar patterns.\n\n## Commit Message Format\n- Use Conventional Commit syntax: `type(scope): short summary` with lowercase verbs (e.g., `feat(server): add jobs repository`).\n- Supported `type` values: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`, `revert`.\n- Scope reflects the primary package or area (`server`, `web`, `shared`, `docs`, etc.); prefer narrower scopes when touching a single subsystem.\n- Begin the summary with an action and keep it under 72 characters; expand on context in the body if needed.\n- Reference sprint story IDs in the body (e.g., `Refs S-014`) so backlog tracking stays automatic.\n- For multi-part commits, separate breaking changes into their own commit with a `!` marker (`feat(server)!: rename jobs table`) and describe the impact in the body.\n\n## Handy Commands & References\n- `pnpm install`: wire workspace dependencies after pulling a story branch.\n- `pnpm --filter server dev`: (scaffold) start the server once runtime layers are in place.\n- `pnpm --filter server migrate`: run `scripts/migrate.ts` through the configured runner.\n- `pnpm --filter web dev`: (scaffold) launch the SvelteKit frontend.\n- External docs: [Effect-TS](https://effect.website/docs), Context7 effect-patterns repo, GitHub REST/Webhook docs.\n\nStay disciplined about the backlog, document decisions, and keep layers composable so every agent can land work quickly without surprises.\n\n## Standards Reference\n\nThe detailed standards now live under `standards/*.md` and are indexed in [STANDARDS.md](./STANDARDS.md).

Record the chosen pattern and rationale in `STORIES.md` when it is novel.\\n- **Consistent layer naming**: production implementations use the `PascalCaseLive` suffix and mocks use `PascalCaseMock`. Avoid hand-rolled helpers; compose full Layers instead.\\n- **Single source of truth**: update `STORIES.md` (or the relevant doc) whenever you add a new service, migration, or workflow so the backlog stays trustworthy.\\n- **Small commits, clear stories**: each story should map to a commit or PR slice with an explicit DoD. Leave TODOs only when the follow-up story already exists.\\n\\n## Repository Orientation\\n- Root workspace is `pnpm`-based with packages `server`, `web`, and `shared`. Scripts such as `dev:server`, `dev:web`, `lint`, and `test` are scaffolds; keep them wired even if they echo TODO.\\n- `.env.example` declares required environment variables: `PORT`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, `ADMIN_KEY`.\\n- `packages/shared`: owns runtime-shared TypeScript codecs (`ApiSchemas`, `WebhookSchemas`). Keep schemas colocated here and import them from server/web.\\n- `packages/server` key areas:\\n  - `src/runtime/NodeRuntime.ts`: entrypoint for composing Layers; always wire new services here.\\n  - `src/config/Config.ts`: environment schema via `@effect/schema`. Extend it when a story introduces a new env var.\\n  - `src/logger/Logger.ts`: structured JSON logging. Preserve requestId propagation.\\n  - `src/http`: platform server setup, routes, and SSE endpoints.\\n  - `src/db`: Effect-based Postgres access. `schema/*.ts` files expose repositories; keep them side-effect free.\\n  - `src/github`: token-backed HTTP client, webhook verification, and event handlers.\\n  - `migrations/*.sql`: sequential, zero-downtime migrations; never edit existing files, always add a new numbered migration.\\n  - `scripts/migrate.ts`: kicks off `Migrations.run()`; extend when migrations runner gains features.\\n- `packages/web`: SvelteKit frontend with Tailwind; pulls codecs from `shared` and listens to SSE events from the server.\\n\\n## Working a Story\\n1. Confirm prerequisites in `STORIES.md` and ensure dependent stories are complete.\\n2. Sketch the Effect wiring (new Layer, service tag, constructor). List new dependencies in the story notes.\\n3. Update or add migrations/scripts before repository code that uses them. Run migrations locally when the tooling is available.\\n4. Fill in stubs instead of replacing them wholesale so later stories remain diff-friendly.\\n5. When implementing webhook handlers, ensure idempotency paths are preserved and rate-limit helpers (`withRateLimit`) are applied where required.\\n6. Record notable decisions and follow-up tickets directly in the backlog or doc comments.\\n\\n## Database & Migrations\\n- Files live in `packages/server/migrations` and follow zero-padded numbering (`000_init.sql`, `001_repos.sql`, ...).\\n- Every migration must have a corresponding repository change in `packages/server/src/db/schema`. Keep SQL and TypeScript updates in the same story so the system stays deployable.\\n- Use effectful repositories (`Effect.gen` + `Db.sql`) to encapsulate queries. Avoid leaking raw SQL into route handlers.\\n- Populate fixtures in `packages/server/test/fixtures` whenever you add new tables or columns; future tests rely on them.\\n\\n## GitHub Integration Guardrails\\n- `GithubClient` must attach the PAT/App token, log rate-limit headers, and respect the rate-limit guard (`S-035`).\\n- Webhook verification uses SHA-256 with the shared secret in `WEBHOOK_SECRET`; never store raw payloads without hashing or encryption.\\n- Event handlers should upsert repos, runs, and jobs atomically so the dashboard never shows partial data.\\n- Document any new webhook types or payload nuances in `packages/server/docs/webhook-dev.md`.\\n\\n## API & Realtime Expectations\\n- Public API endpoints live under `packages/server/src/http/routes/api*.ts`; validate all input with shared codecs.\\n- SSE events (`EventsHub`) must broadcast `run_created`, `run_updated`, and `job_updated` events. Preserve compatibility when adding new event types by gating them behind optional filtering.\\n- Keep admin routes guarded by the `X-Admin-Key` middleware. Never bypass it in production code; use mocks in tests instead.\\n\\n## Frontend Collaboration Notes\\n- Fetch data exclusively through the shared codecs to keep server and client types in sync.\\n- Subscribe to `/events` for live updates and debounce UI mutations to avoid jitter.\\n- Favor progressive enhancement: render server data first, then layer SSE updates and admin actions.\\n\\n## Quality & Observability\\n- Add tests as harnesses become available. Target `packages/server/vitest.config.ts` and `packages/web/vitest.config.ts`.\\n- Extend structured logging with correlation IDs for new async flows (hydration, backfill, reconcile).\\n- Track metrics locally in memory until a long-term sink is introduced; keep counters cheap to reset so tests can verify them.\\n- When new operational tasks appear (backups, pruning, security), append the acceptance checklist in `STORIES.md` and open a matching story.\\n\\n## Working With Documentation & Memories\\n- Re-read `STORIES.md` and the architecture memories at the beginning of each session.\\n- When you discover a better pattern or adapt an Effect idiom, update both `STORIES.md` and this guide as needed.\\n- Keep Context7 references fresh by re-fetching relevant effect documentation before implementing unfamiliar patterns.\\n\\n## Commit Message Format\\n- Use Conventional Commit syntax: `type(scope): short summary` with lowercase verbs (e.g., `feat(server): add jobs repository`).\\n- Supported `type` values: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`, `revert`.\\n- Scope reflects the primary package or area (`server`, `web`, `shared`, `docs`, etc.); prefer narrower scopes when touching a single subsystem.\\n- Begin the summary with an action and keep it under 72 characters; expand on context in the body if needed.\\n- Reference sprint story IDs in the body (e.g., `Refs S-014`) so backlog tracking stays automatic.\\n- For multi-part commits, separate breaking changes into their own commit with a `!` marker (`feat(server)!: rename jobs table`) and describe the impact in the body.\\n\\n## Handy Commands & References\\n- `pnpm install`: wire workspace dependencies after pulling a story branch.\\n- `pnpm --filter server dev`: (scaffold) start the server once runtime layers are in place.\\n- `pnpm --filter server migrate`: run `scripts/migrate.ts` through the configured runner.\\n- `pnpm --filter web dev`: (scaffold) launch the SvelteKit frontend.\\n- External docs: [Effect-TS](https://effect.website/docs), Context7 effect-patterns repo, GitHub REST/Webhook docs.\\n\\nStay disciplined about the backlog, document decisions, and keep layers composable so every agent can land work quickly without surprises.\\n\\n## Standards Reference\\n\\nThe detailed standards now live under `standards/*.md` and are indexed in [STANDARDS.md](./STANDARDS.md). Highlights:\\n\\n- Orientation: [Additional Resources](standards/AdditionalResources.md), [Principles](standards/Principles.md), [Project Structure & Library Types](standards/ProjectStructure.md), [Naming Conventions](standards/Naming.md)\\n- Build & Quality: [Testing & CI](standards/CICD&TESTING.md), [Documentation Standards](standards/Documentation.md), [Effect-ts Integration](standards/EffectIntegration.md), [Cross-Domain Types Architecture](standards/CrossDomainTypes.md), [Dependency Management](standards/DependencyManagement.md), [Release & Versioning](standards/ReleaseVersioning.md), [Monorepo-wide Standards](standards/MonorepoStandards.md), [Platform-Shared Libraries](standards/PlatformSharedLibraries.md), [Security & Secrets](standards/Security.md), [Nx Configuration](standards/NxConfiguration.md)\\n- Workflow & Delivery: [Git Workflow](standards/GitWorkflow.md), [Development Workflow](standards/LocalDev.md), [Checklist for New Code](standards/ChecklistForNewCode.md), [Breaking Changes & Deprecation](standards/BreakingChanges.md), [Error Architecture](standards/ERRORS.md), [Docker & Deployment](standards/DockerDeployment.md), [Architecture Decision Records](standards/ArchitectureDecisions.md), [Troubleshooting](standards/Troubleshooting.md)\\n\\n_Use the topical files for deep dives; this guide stays high-level for quick onboarding and mission guardrails._\\n\\n### Agents Nesting\\nNest Agent.md files for specific packages and apps or libraries. every app/library has an AGENTS.md file for that project. have it be more specific for that projects needs. it should not repeat information in this higher level guide\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Let’s turn this into an **agent-friendly epic → story backlog** built around **Effect-TS** with **@effect/platform / @effect/platform-node** (no Hono), a **repo/org Webhook** (for events) + a **GitHub token** (for hydration/backfill). Each story is intentionally tiny (≈15–60 min), has clear DoD, inputs/outputs, and dependencies so an agent can pick up any leaf and ship.\\n\\n> 🔁 **Effect-TS first**: before writing new code, pause to choose the appropriate Effect-TS pattern (Layer, Context, Scope, Queue, etc.). Match the ticket’s needs to the idioms in the Effect docs **and** consult the effect-patterns repo via Context7 to pull in the recommended approach so we stay idiomatic and avoid re-inventing helpers. When stubbing dependencies in tests, name mock layers with the `PascalCaseMock` convention (e.g., `ReposMock`, `RunsMock`) to keep the distinction from production `Live` layers crystal clear.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Program structure\\n\\n* **Tracks** (Epics): 0–9\\n* Each epic has **very small stories** (S-IDs).\\n* Labels you can apply in your tracker: `effect`, `sql`, `api`, `sse`, `github`, `ui`, `admin`, `ops`, `tests`.\\n\\n## Monorepo modularity principles\\n\\n- Follow the [Nx folder structure](https://nx.dev/docs/concepts/decisions/folder-structure) so shared libraries live under dedicated `libs/*` boundaries instead of ad-hoc package folders.\\n- Enforce [Nx project dependency rules](https://nx.dev/docs/concepts/decisions/project-dependency-rules) with tags to keep feature domains decoupled; no `tsconfig` path tricks—depend via pnpm workspaces only.\\n- Manage cross-package dependency versions through pnpm catalogs and reference them via `catalog:` specifiers inside each `package.json`.\\n- Introduce repository-level typecheck targets (e.g., `nx run-many --target=typecheck`) so every package can be type-checked together.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Epic 0 — Repo & Runtime Foundation\\n\\n**Goal:** A compilable workspace with Effect runtime, config, and logging.\\n\\n**S-001** Init monorepo\\n\\n* DoD: `pnpm` workspaces;
