Modules follow `Hk.<Feature>.*` for reusable code and `MCP.*` for agent integrations; leave executable modules as `Main`. Limit `{-# LANGUAGE #-}` pragmas, enabling extras only where needed. Builds enable `-Wall`/compatibility warnings—treat all warnings as errors and run them clean before posting a review.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\nUnit and property tests live in `test/*Spec.hs` and are auto-discovered via `hspec-discover`. Mirror source module names, e.g. `BatterySpec` for `Hk/Battery`. Use QuickCheck for invariants (see `test/BatterySpec.hs`), and temporary directories for IO-heavy checks. Ensure new features carry tests covering success, failure, and boundary cases, then run `stack test` (or targeted `stack test system-scripts:test --ta '--match \"Battery\"'`) prior to pushing.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\nCommit subjects should be imperative with a scoped prefix (`battery: handle missing capacity`), and bodies list rationale plus validation commands. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under “Unreleased” for user-visible changes. Pull requests need a concise summary, linked issue (if any), test evidence (`stack test` output or reasoning for skips), and mention of config touch-points (e.g. systemd units).\n\n## Security & Configuration Tips\nAvoid hard-coding local paths; prefer environment variables such as `BAT_PATH` and leverage helpers in `Hk.Backup.Config`. Scripts that shell out (`Hk.Util.Notify`, backup rsync) inherit the caller environment—sanitize inputs and document new flags. For systemd usage, export binaries via `stack install` and keep credentials outside the repo.\n","git":{"commit_hash":"176cfa21095361a62aafb6cbf682239fccabd042","branch":"master"}}}
